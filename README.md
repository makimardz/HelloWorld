# Overview

This is a demo of simple integration on Visual Studio Code, Github and Javascript.

I wanted to show show Javascript can change the content of a simple html page. Where if you click on some the Javascript code will produce another outcome.

The purpose of creating this software is to showcase my knowledge while learning Javascript.
